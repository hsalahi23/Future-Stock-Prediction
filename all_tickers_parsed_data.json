A mouse model of immune TRALI was triggered by injection of LPS and an anti-MHC I antibody, and the effect of injection of a neutralizing anti-CD40L antibody before induction of TRALI investigated. The characteristics of TRALI were decreased body temperature, pulmonary lesions, and immune cell infiltration into the alveolar space. Pulmonary infiltration was evaluated by blood counts of specific immune cells and their detection in lung sections. Inhibition of the CD40/CD40L immunomodulator interaction significantly reduced communication between immune and/or endothelial cells and the development of pulmonary edema. Hence, our results indicate that targeting of the CD40/CD40L interaction could be an important method to prevent TRALI. While considering that our work concerned a mouse model, we postulate that improvement of the conditions under which platelet concentrates are prepared/stored would assist in alleviating the risk of TRALI.", 1663275190], ["Lesson learned.", 1663281728], ["@Macrocosmonaut I still think it\u2019s all lies, my 2021 investment of $7500 is worth $188 with an average of 219 shares at $31.40/share.

With cases doubling every two weeks or so, there\u2019s a growing risk that monkeypox will become a permanent problem in countries where, before, outbreaks were rare and small.\nRead This Guide - Find Out if You Qualify\nAd\nwww.ovidlife.com\nRead This Guide - Find Out if You Qualify\nThe pox is, in other words, close to becoming endemic in a lot of new places. If that happens, it might become very difficult to eradicate. Monkeypox, which causes a fever and rash and is fatal in a very small number of cases, will become yet another disease that people have to worry about all the time.\nFor the pox, there are two paths to endemicity. If the virus infects enough people fast enough to outpace authorities\u2019 efforts to trace transmission and vaccinate at-risk individuals, it might become endemic in people. \u201cWe are getting close to this already,\u201d James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told The Daily Beast.\nThe good news with this kind of endemicity is that it doesn\u2019t have to be permanent. Reversing human endemicity is hard, yes\u2014but it\u2019s possible. \u201cIf it\u2019s just spreading in humans it can be controlled\u2014eventually\u2014through vaccination and natural immunity,\u201d Amesh Adalja, a public-health expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told The Daily Beast.\nBut monkeypox was originally a \u201czoonotic\u201d animal virus. It circulates in rodent and monkey species in West and Central Africa, where outbreaks in the human population are frequent.\nIf the pox finds a home in some animal species in North America or Europe\u2014say, squirrels, rats or prairie dogs\u2014it\u2019ll be all but impossible to eradicate regionally. \u201cGame over,\u201d Lawler said. The pox will be all around us, probably forever, just waiting for opportunities to spread from animals to people. Outbreaks will be frequent and big, just like they are now in West and Central Africa.\nTo be clear, the pox is not endemic in people or animals in the United States or Europe\u2014yet. But the trends aren\u2019t encouraging. \u201cI do share the other scientists\u2019 concern of containment and the virus becoming endemic in our U.S. rodent population,\u201d Stephanie James, the head of a viral testing lab at Regis University in Colorado, told The Daily Beast.\nOfficials first noticed the current outbreak, involving a relatively mild West African strain of the pox, after diagnosing a U.K. traveler returning from Nigeria in early May. Spreading through close physical contact including sex, the pox soon accompanied travelers on planes heading for countries far and wide. Doctors diagnosed the first U.S. case on May 27.\nBut it\u2019s apparent now that the first diagnosed pox cases in Europe and the U.S. weren\u2019t the real first cases. On June 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it had found genetic evidence of American pox cases that predated the first cases in Europe from May.\nRelated video: The Full Context | Monkeypox is now a global emergency | Should we be worried?\nThe Full Context | Monkeypox is now a global emergency | Should we be worried?\nDoctors may not have noticed or reported these earlier infections, at first, owing to the similarity between pox symptoms and the symptoms of some common sexually-transmitted diseases such as herpes. \u201cThe virus was masquerading as a sexually transmitted infection and had been spreading clandestinely for several months,\u201d Adalja explained.\nThe virus had a big head start, which helps to explain why, months later, it\u2019s still staying ahead of intensifying efforts to contain it. There were 20,638 confirmed cases in 77 countries as of Wednesday, according to the CDC. That\u2019s up from fewer than 10,000 cases two weeks ago. The World Health Organization has counted five pox-related deaths in non-endemic countries.\nWhat\u2019s frustrating to epidemiologists is that, in theory, we had all the tools we needed to swiftly contain a pox outbreak. Thanks to COVID, health workers all over the world are better than ever at contact-tracing. Vaccines and therapies that work for smallpox also work for monkeypox. There\u2019s a proven strategy: diagnose cases, isolate and treat the infected, vaccinate their family, friends and co-workers.\nAnd educate the public\u2014especially the highest-risk groups including men who have sex with men.\nBut so far, the strategy isn\u2019t working. Part of the problem is with the virus itself, Lawler said. \u201cThe disease is different than the monkeypox we have seen in the past. I don\u2019t think we know why\u2014probably a combo of virus, hosts and environment.\u201d\nMostly", 1659357191], ["Up to your nose...

I have been in the stock with some hedges to protect myself for over a year now.

They have produced a lot of patents and matured their clinical trials to bring them closer to fda review. \n* they are not really building pipeline in a competitive market - they are finding solutions for neglected diseases and clinical conditions truly cumbersome to manage. So one success out of a dozen products in the pipeline is bringing this company to a market cap of over a billion $$$. \n* they are far away in their game and bring their products really late. Covid vaccine, their timeline was so far away that they just kept on slowly pulling the ceiling shot while Covid came and technically (politically) is gone too. The monkeypox is going to be similar. \n*monkeypox game is going to be different, we have new vp taking the leadership of infectious diseases, has a lot of experience running trials and have a very strong ties to government and affiliated agencies. \n*live vaccine is going to take a long time for sure. I am thinking like the trend of run would be something like ocgn, but hoping to have a better end result compared to ocgn. \n*cocaine is an expensive substance, while meth and fentanyl is comparatively cheaper substance. This also means that if it goes to the market, cocaine intoxication population would be more likely to afford expensive product. \n* clinical trials run much faster in developing world once they get the approval for a trial. Running a trial in developing world actually comes with so many red tapes, therefore we ended up running so many trials in United States, just because getting across those tapes is nearly impossible. This is a great news for hell the the global community. \n1) reality - the original price of a share here approximately is $1million. They are trading at $1 - means the original investors lost 100% of their money. \n2) short percentage is quite low, but average short volume on any given day (more than 95% of days) is about 70%. So this stock has been owned by short sellers, dark pools and scalpers. \n3) the ceo is a total rubbish and have been diluting shares to pay his staffs, and run clinical trials for over a decade now. \n4) people who throw any numbers without any backup data and stats like ($3 tomorrow or $1 by the end of the day or all gain will be lost etc) they are just barking dogs and should be taken exactly as barking dogs.\n5) chances are I may lose my money, I might take my hedges off and let it run more freely.

They have only limited information about people who have been diagnosed, and they don\u2019t know how many infected people might be spreading it unknowingly.\nThey also don\u2019t know how well vaccines and treatments are working. One impediment: Federal health officials do not have the authority to collect and connect data on who has been infected and who has been vaccinated.\nWith such huge question marks, predictions about how big the U.S. outbreak will get this summer vary widely, from 13,000 to perhaps more than 10 times that number.\nDr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the government\u2019s response is growing stronger every day and vaccine supplies will soon surge.\n\u201cI think we still have an opportunity to contain this,\u201d Walensky told The Associated Press.\nMonkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. It does not usually spread easily among people.\nBut this year more than 15,000 cases have been reported in countries that historically don\u2019t see the disease. In the U.S. and Europe, the vast majority of infections have happened in men who have sex with men, though health officials have stressed that anyone can catch the virus.\nIt spreads mainly through skin-to-skin contact, but it can also be transmitted through linens used by someone with monkeypox. Although it\u2019s been moving through the population like a sexually transmitted disease, officials have been watching for other types of spread that could expand the outbreak.\nSymptoms include fever, body aches, chills, fatigue and the bumps on parts of the body. The illness has been relatively mild in many men, and no one has died in the U.S. But people can be contagious for weeks, and the lesions can be extremely painful.\nWhen monkeypox emerged, there was reason to believe that public health officials could control it.\nThe tell-tale bumps should have made infections easy to identify. And because the virus spreads through close personal contact, officials thought they could reliably trace its spread by interviewing infected people and asking who they had been intimate with.\nIt didn\u2019t turn out to be that easy.\nWith monkeypox so rare in the U.S., many infected men \u2014 and their doctors \u2014 may have attributed their rashes to some other cause.\nContact tracing was often stymied by infected men who said they did not know the names of all the people they had sex with. Some reported having multiple sexual interactions with strangers.\nIt didn\u2019t help that local health departments, already burdened with COVID-19 and scores of other diseases, now had to find the resources to do intensive contact-tracing work on monkeypox, too.\nIndeed, some local health officials have given up expecting much from contact tracing.\nThere was another reason to be optimistic: The U.S. government already had a vaccine. The two-dose regimen called Jynneos was licensed in the U.S. in 2019 and recommended last year as a tool against monkeypox.\nWhen the outbreak was first identified in May, U.S. officials had only about 2,000 doses available. The government distributed them but limited the shots to people who were identified through public health investigations as being recently exposed to the virus.\nLate last month, as more doses became available, the CDC began recommending that shots be offered to those who realize on their own that they could have been infected.\nDemand has exceeded supply, with clinics in some cities rapidly running out of vaccine doses and health officials across the country saying said they don\u2019t have enough.\nThat\u2019s changing, Walensky said. As of this week, the government has distributed more than 191,000 doses, and it has 160,000 more ready to send. As many as 780,000 doses will become available as early as next week.\nOnce current demand is satisfied, the government will look at expanding vaccination efforts.\nThe CDC believes that 1.5 million U.S. men are considered at high risk for the infection.\nTesting has also expanded. More than 70,000 people can be tested each week, far more than current demand, Walensky said. The government has also embarked on a campaign to educate doctors and gay and bisexual men about the disease, she added.", 1658487989], ["I want a poster  of Seth  with his address on it  so I can pay him a  visit  with my NRA Aryan militia buddies", 1658451748], ["He is in a top secret fortress paid by all our stocks.", 1658498589], ["Get out of this garbage while you can before this thieves take all you money this #$%$ doesn&#39;t worth it, waste of money and time and you get stressed every time you look on it going down and down, this garbage will never give you a dime in profit they will just stole you money dollar after dollar until you wake up one day with 000000$", 1658433455], ["If you read some of the post, you would have sold right after RS .", 1658498719], ["I want a poster  of Seth  with his address on it  so I can pay him a  visit  with my NRA Aryan militia buddies", 1658451748], ["He is in a top secret fortress paid by all our stocks.", 1658498589], ["Get out of this garbage while you can before this thieves take all you money this #$%$ doesn&#39;t worth it, waste of money and time and you get stressed every time you look on it going down and down, this garbage will never give you a dime in profit they will just stole you money dollar after dollar until you wake up one day with 000000$", 1658433455], ["If you read some of the post, you would have sold right after RS .", 1658498719], ["They just stole my hard earned money", 1658433172], ["Scam", 1658433112], ["Money stolen", 1658433108], ["Thieves", 1658433086], ["Garbage", 1658433070], ["TNXP will increase the # of shares by 10x soon.

Ten years later, someone needs it.\nA sign of diverse economic growth\nWith Massachusetts recognized as a leader in life sciences and biotechnology, Congressman Bill Keating said Tonix exemplifies the potential for growth in Greater New Bedford, with Dartmouth officials successfully securing the company\u2019s commitment and New Bedford recognized as a platinum bioready community.

After infecting PBMCs with an optimized concentration of VV or MPV, we measured virus-specific T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining analysis (ICCS) (10, 40, 45). CD14+ monocytes represent the main cell type infected by these viruses (40) (data not shown), and they have the capacity to present peptides to both virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In Fig. 1A, we measured the frequency of IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells after culture in medium alone (negative control used for background subtraction) or after stimulation with VV or MPV. Although VV-specific T cells were clearly able to recognize and respond to VV-infected cells (1239 IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ T cells per million CD8+ T cells), they were largely incapable of responding to MPV-infected cells (27 IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ T cells per million CD8+ T cells).\n&gt;This result indicated that either the immunodominant peptides of MPV differed from VV or that MPV was evading virus-specific T cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the T cell responses of MPV-immune individuals as well. Similarly to the results observed with the VV-specific T cells, MPV-specific T cells could recognize VV-infected cells but were unable to respond to MPV-infected cells (830 vs. 28 IFN\u03b3+TNF\u03b1+ T cells per million CD8+ T cells).\nThe synthethic Horsepox Virus vaccine of Tonix Pharmaceuticals has a real chance to prevent MPX-infections in humans.\nDo your own due dilligence.", 1654817848], ["@Justin Seider Instead of posting these childish GIFs you might respond with some arguments.

To suggest there was an outage at a prime center for more than 2-3 days without justification is &#34;DEATH&#34; with the industry (no one will again allow you to host critical applications!). Now today, almost as bad, we have an unscheduled outage at the Garden City center with one-day noticed to take a trans-sub down for &#34;routine maintenance&#34; ..... are you kidding me?? Routine maintenance for a trans-sub is scheduled months in advance .... not with 1-day notice which does not allow the Center to redistribute hosted service to other capacity within the system. Whomever authorized these &#34;news&#34; events must believe the shareholders have zero experience in power Mgmt. and the running of hosted centers.
